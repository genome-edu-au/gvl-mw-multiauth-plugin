----------
* Still working on 1.4.0 
* Fixed returnto parameter, so that it never points to the 
  MultiAuthSpecialLogin or MultiAuthSpecialLogout page.
  This way the user will never enter a login/logout loop by clicking
  on the "Back to..." links.
* Changed configuration options to support one authentication library per method
  In theory you could use Shibboleth and SimpleSamlPHP in parallel now
* Some cleaning in the configuration options
* Also added per method auth configuration options depending on the configured
  authentication library
* 'local' authentication method is now hardcoded and removed from configuration options
* Open issue with call to MessageCache->recache() on every page view!

----------
* Bump to version 1.4.0
* compatibility with Mediawiki 1.18.0
* worked around some localisation issues 
* MultiAuth now ignores requests to load.php -> performance
